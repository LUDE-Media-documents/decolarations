## Mainland China Liberty Declaration
Since the end of World War II, Western nations led by the United States have
established an international order based on law. This has granted the world over 70
years of peace, where people from different countries have collaborated and mutually
benefited. Despite China rising to become the world's second-largest economy, ordinary
folks in mainland China still find themselves earning the lowest wages, enduring the
toughest jobs, facing the greatest risks, and lacking basic social security. We need to
alter this reality to ensure that every person's sacred rights, bestowed by the divine, are
honored. Hence, we must declare to the world the reasons that drive us to change.

We firmly believe in these fundamental truths, which speak for themselves:
1. God created humanity, endowing every individual with inherent and equal
rights, such as the right to life, freedom, and the pursuit of happiness.
2. In order to protect these rights, people collectively authorize the
establishment of councils, governments, courts, and armies. Their purpose is to
formulate and uphold rules that ensure a safe environment and safeguard each
person's rights from infringement.
3. When governments, armies, and courts neglect their duties to the people,
succumb to the dominance of a single political party, and continuously infringe
upon the basic rights of individuals. It is the right of the people to revoke their
consent, overthrow the existing authorities, and re-establish a secure foundation
for the future.

The history of China's Central People's Government is characterized by violent seizure
of power, political movements harming millions, and a distortion of truth through
deceptive propaganda. Currently, they enforce nationwide lockdowns in the name of the
pandemic, which resulted in individuals with illnesses left untreated, leading to fatalities.
Moreover, those under lockdown are unable to access essential necessities, resulting in
starvation. Additionally, individuals enduring prolonged loss of freedom are experiencing
mental collapse and resorting to suicide. A new political wave replaces Red Guards with
White Guards, escalating fear.

As Chinese people, we have always been a kind and peaceful nation, adept at diligent
work. Faced with the absurdity happening on our land today, we can no longer remain
silent. It is our collective mission to unite and reclaim the power bestowed upon us by
God from the hands of the robbers.

To prove its necessity, the following facts are hereby declared to the world:
1. He personally ordered the release of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which
originated from experiments conducted in a military laboratory in Wuhan, causing
millions of deaths and hundreds of millions of infections worldwide.
2. During the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, he signed multi-billion dollar oil
and natural gas contracts with Russian President Putin to support Russia's
invasion of Ukraine, cementing a military alliance.
3. Despite global sanctions imposed on Russia for war crimes committed in
Ukraine, he continues to provide material, weapons, and financial support to
Russia.
4. To solidify his power, he engineered the pandemic, enforced city
lockdowns, conducted numerous rounds of mass nucleic acid testing, forcibly
quarantined individuals in makeshift hospitals, all without any logical treatment
plans, resulting in humanitarian disasters worldwide.
5. He amended the constitution to remove the two-term limit on the
presidency, with the intention of holding power for life.
6. He trusted a self-proclaimed Taoist priest named Farong Ren from the
Quanzhen Sect, planning to construct an emperor-level mausoleum for his father,
Zhongxun Xi, in Fuping County, Shanxi Province, with intentions of declaring
himself emperor and reinstating China's imperial system.
7. He had an illegitimate child with an international chess champion in his
early years, laying the groundwork for a dynasty.
8. He tore apart the "Sino-British Joint Declaration" that guaranteed Hong
Kong's autonomy for 50 years, deploying the People's Liberation Army and
armed police to suppress peaceful protests in Hong Kong, completely
undermining its autonomy.
9. He persecuted Uighur compatriots in Xinjiang, establishing Xinjiang re-
education camps akin to Nazi concentration camps, committing crimes of
genocide and against humanity.
10. He vigorously constructs prison-industrial complexes nationwide, utilizing
free labor to produce goods for low-cost dumping in markets, grossly violating
human rights and disrupting market order.
11. During the era of the Republic of China, the Chinese Communist Party
seized power through false propaganda, espionage infiltration, and armed
uprisings, illegally establishing the Central People's Government of the People's
Republic of China.
12. After the illegal establishment of the People's Republic of China, the
regime artificially created the so-called Three Years of Natural Disasters and the
Ten Years of Turmoil during the Cultural Revolution.
13. On June 4, 1989, the government of the People's Republic of China
brutally suppressed peaceful student gatherings expressing legitimate grievances
with tanks and machine guns.
14. They established the 610 Office to persecute Falun Gong practitioners,
engaging in the forced harvesting of organs.
15. They fear people's faith, thus persecuting believers of Christianity, Tibetan
Buddhism, and Islam nationwide, infiltrating party branches into religious
institutions, and undermining religious culture.
16. They also enforced the one-child policy, resulting in the forced abortion
and death of tens of millions of unborn babies, inflicting indescribable pain upon
these mothers.

For over a century, the specter of communism has haunted the land of China, its
atrocities too numerous to count. It has brought endless disasters to the Chinese nation,
with countless individuals persecuted to death. Many more are currently suffering in
Xinjiang concentration camps, Xianning prisons, and homes sealed shut by the
authoritiesâ€¦.. Nationwide, people endure persecution under CCP authority.

This isn't a decision made lightly. Our people have endured generations of struggle over
many decades, hoping that the Chinese Communist Party would relinquish its
authoritarian rule and gradually introduce political reforms to empower the people.
However, despite CCP's rhetoric about reform, authoritarianism is on the rise. After a
decade under Xi Jinping's leadership, he aims to consolidate lifelong and hereditary
power, pushing authoritarianism to its extreme. This oppressive regime oppresses the
people, seizes wealth, and leaves the populace in dire straits.

Henceforth, in the name of God, we appeal to the highest justice across the globe,
expressing our firm intentions and solemnly proclaiming: We no longer recognize the
government of the People's Republic of China and its affiliated institutions. We will
exercise the sacred rights granted by God to democratically elect a government that
genuinely represents each of us, ensuring the protection of our fundamental rights. We
urge all freedom-loving individuals worldwide to unite and dismantle the influence of
communism. We stand resolutely under the shelter of God, pledging our lives,
possessions, and honor to one another.
